# k8sconfigs

This repo contains configurations created by following [this video](https://youtu.be/s_o8dwzRlu4?si=C8htRIN_yYVEzcaL)

## Purpose

I'm learning k8s to be able to deploy an application at my current internship. I've expanded the video a little bit by updating the mongodb pod to use a stateful set with a volume instead of a deployment.

In a real world scenario, do not publish config maps or secrets to a repository!
